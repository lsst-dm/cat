Rubin Data Model Definitions
============================

The files in this directory contain definitions, in the "Felis" format,
of the data models for the Rubin Observatory's public and principal internal
catalog and observation metadata tabular data products, including IVOA-related
metadata.

See [the main README for this repository](../README.md) for more information.

Note that only the ".yaml" extension for YAML files is supported by the
build mechanisms for this repository.
